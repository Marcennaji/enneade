## üìã Before You Start

- Ensure you have read and understood the [README](README.md).
- Ensure your work aligns with the project goals: clean code, modular architecture, modern C++ best practices.
- Familiarize yourself with our code quality tools (CppDepend, SonarQube) and coding style.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository and **clone** it locally.

2. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName
   ```

3. **Make your changes**, keeping the following in mind:
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable C++ code.
   - Respect SOLID principles and design guidelines.
   - Avoid introducing new code smells or quality regressions.
   - Add or update unit tests and integration tests if necessary.

4. **Build and Test**:
   - Ensure that the project builds successfully.
   - Run all tests and verify that they pass.
   - Check that CppDepend/SonarQube quality gates are satisfied.

5. **Commit your changes**:
   - Write clear and concise commit messages.
   - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Refactor").

6. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/YourFeatureName
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request** against the main branch:
   - Describe what you have done and why.
   - Reference related issues if applicable (Closes #123).

## üßπ Code Style

- Prefer modern C++ standards (C++17 or later).
- Use smart pointers over raw pointers where applicable.
- Favor composition over inheritance when possible.
- Minimize dependencies between modules.
- Write small, single-responsibility functions and classes.
